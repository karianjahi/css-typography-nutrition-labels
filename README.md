# CSS Typography Nutrition Labels


## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a **nutrition facts label** using semantic HTML and CSS, with a strong focus on **typography**, **layout**, and **accessibility**. The design replicates the familiar format found on food packaging in the United States and is ideal for learning advanced CSS techniques, especially with fonts, spacing, and responsive layout.

## Design Notes

- The layout uses **flexbox** to align key nutritional values to the right.
- CSS utility classes like `.indent`, `.double-indent`, `.divider`, and `.bold` make the stylesheet modular and reusable.
- Focus was placed on accurate spacing, hierarchy, and font-weight to mirror official nutrition labels.
